<!-- In this tutorial we learn how to declare variables in JavaScript. Variables are used to store data that can be used later in the program. To declare a variable in JavaScript, you use the var keyword followed by the name of the variable. Here is an example of declaring a variable in JavaScript: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Variables in JavaScript</title>
<script>
    // It explains that we are declaring a variable in JavaScript.
    
    // variable name can contain letters, numbers, underscores, or dollar signs.

    // variable name between space is not allowed.
    var myName = "Abdul Rehman.";
// The variable name is myName, and the value of the variable is Abdul Rehman.
    document.write("My full name is " + myName + "<br>");
