// for loop is used to execute a block of code a number of times.

// Syntax of for loop in JavaScript.

// while loop in JavaScript.

// while loop is used to execute a block of code as long as the condition is true.

// Syntax of while loop in JavaScript.

// while (condition) {}

// Example of while loop in JavaScript.

// do while loop in JavaScript.

// do while loop is used to execute a block of code once, then the condition is evaluated, and if the condition is true, the block of code will be executed again.

// Syntax of do while loop in JavaScript.

// do {} while (condition);
